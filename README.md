#Week 1 (Orientation and Discussion of Syllabus)
- I learned the topics to be discussed in this course, outputs and requirements needed to be accomplished for this course
- I learned the use of truth table for proving
- I learned to use logical connectives 
- I learned to propositional variables to represent propositions

#Week 2 
- I learned about different logical equivalances and how it can be used for proofs.
- I learned about quantifiers and the difference between existential quantifier and universal quantifier.
- I learned about rules of inferences and how it can be used in arguments.

#Week 3
- I learned about the different rules of inferences such as modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism and disjunctive syllogism.
- I learned to determine whether a statement is a fallacy or not using truth tables and the rules of inferences.
- I learned to use the rules of inferences to prove the validity of an argument.
- I also learned to use these rules of inferences to build arguments.

#Week 4 
- I learned different ways to prove an argument through different ways like direct proof,proof by contraposition, trivial proof and vacuous proof.
- I learned the steps on how to perform these proofs and use it in a problem.
- Our class answered different examples to be able to master using these methods of proof.

#Week 5
- I learned about proof by equivalence
- Using proof by equivalence is a bit more lengthy than the other proofs but it is more interesting and exciting.
- Our class answered different examples where we can apply proof by equivalance
- I learned about mathematical induction and the process of how it is done
- Mathematical induction involves a basis and an inductive step(direct proof)
- I learned about Recursive/Inductive Defintion and Recursive Algorithm
- Our class answered various exercises about Recursive Definition and Recursive Algorithm

#Week 6
- Our class continued the discussion about Recursive Algorithm
- We answered additional exercises about Recursive Algorithm
- I learned about Program Correctness and its steps
- The first step is about partial correctness.
- First, I need to prove the correct answer is obtained if the program terminates (PARTIAL CORRECTNESS)
- The second step is to show that the program always terminates.
- I also learned about the Inital Assertion which gives that the input values must have and the Final Assertion which are output values.
- I also learned about the Hoare Triple: p{S}q
- Our class answered exercises about Program Correctness
- I learned about Zeno's Paradox and the Power Series.
- Our class answered different exercises to further improve our understanding about Zeno's Paradox and Power Series
- I discovered about the Set Theory and what a Power Set is and what Cardinality means.

#Week 7
- I learned about subset and superset
- I learned about the One-to-One Function or Injective, Onto Function or Surjective and lastly, the Bijective
- I also learned the one-to-many which is not function

#Week 8
- Time to do our Project 0-0 or the Hello World Application using MIT App Inventor
- This is an individual project

#Week 9
- I learned about algorithm
- I learned about precondition which are input values and postcondition which are output values

#Week 10
-I learned about linear search and binary search 
-Linear search -> in this kind of search, it searches individually or one by one
-Binary search -> in this kind, the list is divided into two and comparison is being done. It will stop when the first 
and last element is common.
- We discussed in class the different kinds of sorting in increasing order:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Greedy Algorithm
- We did exercises to test our understanding of the pseudocode and analyse the function or purpose of each block of code in the pseudocode.
