#Week 1 (Orientation and Discussion of Syllabus)
- I learned the topics to be discussed in this course, outputs and requirements needed to be accomplished for this course
- I learned the use of truth table for proving
- I learned to use logical connectives 
- I learned to propositional variables to represent propositions

#Week 2 
- I learned about different logical equivalances and how it can be used for proofs.
- I learned about quantifiers and the difference between existential quantifier and universal quantifier.
- I learned about rules of inferences and how it can be used in arguments.

#Week 3
- I learned about the different rules of inferences such as modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism and disjunctive syllogism.
- I learned to determine whether a statement is a fallacy or not using truth tables and the rules of inferences.
- I learned to use the rules of inferences to prove the validity of an argument.
- I also learned to use these rules of inferences to build arguments.

#Week 4 
- I learned different ways to prove an argument through different ways like direct proof,proof by contraposition, trivial proof and vacuous proof.
- I learned the steps on how to perform these proofs and use it in a problem.
- Our class answered different examples to be able to master using these methods of proof.

#Week 5
- I learned about proof by equivalence
- Using proof by equivalence is a bit more lengthy than the other proofs but it is more interesting and exciting.
- Our class answered different examples where we can apply proof by equivalance
- I learned about mathematical induction and the process of how it is done
- Mathematical induction involves a basis and an inductive step(direct proof)
- I learned about Recursive/Inductive Defintion and our class started to discuss Recursive Algorithms
